Help me generate code for my project. I Need to write in Rust. I need email notifications for accout-relatedevents and file-relateed activities for my multi-user filesharing and collaboration platform.EditI'd be happy to help you generate Rust code for email notifications in your multi-user file sharing and collaboration platform. Let's break this down into steps and create a basic structure for the notification system. We'll focus on two main types of notifications: account-related events and file-related activities.
First, let's create a basic structure for our notification system:
rustCopyuse lettre::message::header::ContentType;
use lettre::transport::smtp::authentication::Credentials;
use lettre::{Message, SmtpTransport, Transport};

struct NotificationSystem {
    smtp_credentials: Credentials,
    smtp_server: String,
}

enum NotificationType {
    AccountEvent(AccountEvent),
    FileActivity(FileActivity),
}

enum AccountEvent {
    Registration,
    PasswordChange,
    LoginAttempt,
}

enum FileActivity {
    Upload,
    Download,
    Share,
    Edit,
}

impl NotificationSystem {
    fn new(username: String, password: String, smtp_server: String) -> Self {
        NotificationSystem {
            smtp_credentials: Credentials::new(username, password),
            smtp_server,
        }
    }

    fn send_notification(&self, to_email: &str, notification_type: NotificationType) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
        let (subject, body) = self.generate_content(notification_type);

        let email = Message::builder()
            .from("Your Platform <noreply@yourplatform.com>".parse()?)
            .to(to_email.parse()?)
            .subject(subject)
            .header(ContentType::TEXT_PLAIN)
            .body(body)?;

        let mailer = SmtpTransport::relay(&self.smtp_server)?
            .credentials(self.smtp_credentials.clone())
            .build();

        mailer.send(&email)?;

        Ok(())
    }

    fn generate_content(&self, notification_type: NotificationType) -> (String, String) {
        match notification_type {
            NotificationType::AccountEvent(event) => self.generate_account_event_content(event),
            NotificationType::FileActivity(activity) => self.generate_file_activity_content(activity),
        }
    }

    fn generate_account_event_content(&self, event: AccountEvent) -> (String, String) {
        match event {
            AccountEvent::Registration => (
                "Welcome to Our Platform".to_string(),
                "Thank you for registering with our platform. We're excited to have you on board!".to_string(),
            ),
            AccountEvent::PasswordChange => (
                "Password Change Notification".to_string(),
                "Your password has been successfully changed. If you didn't make this change, please contact support immediately.".to_string(),
            ),
            AccountEvent::LoginAttempt => (
                "New Login Attempt".to_string(),
                "A new login attempt was detected on your account. If this wasn't you, please secure your account immediately.".to_string(),
            ),
        }
    }

    fn generate_file_activity_content(&self, activity: FileActivity) -> (String, String) {
        match activity {
            FileActivity::Upload => (
                "New File Uploaded".to_string(),
                "A new file has been uploaded to your account.".to_string(),
            ),
            FileActivity::Download => (
                "File Downloaded".to_string(),
                "One of your files has been downloaded.".to_string(),
            ),
            FileActivity::Share => (
                "File Shared".to_string(),
                "One of your files has been shared with another user.".to_string(),
            ),
            FileActivity::Edit => (
                "File Edited".to_string(),
                "One of your files has been edited.".to_string(),
            ),
        }
    }
}
This code provides a basic structure for your notification system. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

We define a NotificationSystem struct that holds SMTP credentials and server information.
We create enums for NotificationType, AccountEvent, and FileActivity to categorize different types of notifications.
The send_notification method handles sending emails using the lettre crate.
The generate_content method determines the appropriate content based on the notification type.
Separate methods for generating account event and file activity content are provided.

To use this system, you would create an instance of NotificationSystem and call the send_notification method when needed. For example:
rustCopyfn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let notification_system = NotificationSystem::new(
        "your_username".to_string(),
        "your_password".to_string(),
        "smtp.example.com".to_string(),
    );

    notification_system.send_notification(
        "user@example.com",
        NotificationType::AccountEvent(AccountEvent::Registration),
    )?;

    notification_system.send_notification(
        "user@example.com",
        NotificationType::FileActivity(FileActivity::Upload),
    )?;

    Ok(())
}
This code provides a foundation for your email notification system. You'll need to integrate it with your existing user management and file handling systems. Also, remember to handle errors appropriately and consider adding more detailed information to the notifications (e.g., including the filename for file activities).
Would you like me to explain or break down any part of this code further?
