Help me generate code for my project. I Need to write in Rust. I need a File Upload and storage.EditI'd be happy to help you generate Rust code for file upload and storage. Let's start with a basic structure and then we can build upon it. Here's a simple example to get you started:
rustCopyuse std::fs;
use std::io::Write;
use std::path::Path;

fn upload_file(file_name: &str, content: &[u8]) -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let upload_dir = "uploads";
    
    // Create the upload directory if it doesn't exist
    fs::create_dir_all(upload_dir)?;
    
    let file_path = Path::new(upload_dir).join(file_name);
    
    // Write the content to the file
    let mut file = fs::File::create(file_path)?;
    file.write_all(content)?;
    
    Ok(())
}

fn main() {
    let file_name = "example.txt";
    let content = b"This is an example file content.";
    
    match upload_file(file_name, content) {
        Ok(_) => println!("File uploaded successfully!"),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Error uploading file: {}", e),
    }
}
Would you like me to explain or break down this code?
