Help me generate code for my project. I Need to write in Rust. For filesharing and collaboration function in document editing is necessary.

Creating a full-featured document editing application with file sharing and collaboration functionality in Rust is a complex task that goes beyond the scope of a single response. However, I can provide you with a high-level overview of how you might approach this project and some resources to get you started.

File Sharing: You can use the std::fs module in Rust for basic file operations. For more advanced file sharing, you might want to consider using a library like tokio for asynchronous I/O, and warp for building a web server. You can also use serde for serializing and deserializing data.

Collaboration: Real-time collaboration can be achieved using WebSockets. You can use the tokio-tungstenite library for WebSocket support in Rust. For document editing, you might want to consider using a library like y-crdt which implements a Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) for real-time collaborative editing.

Document Editing: For document editing, you might want to consider using a library like ropey which provides a rope data structure for efficient string manipulation. You can also use a library like syntect for syntax highlighting.

User Interface: For the user interface, you might want to consider using a library like iced which is a cross-platform GUI library for Rust.
