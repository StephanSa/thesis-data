I'd be happy to review the code for potential security flaws or vulnerabilities. While the code provides a basic structure for an email notification system, there are indeed some security considerations we should address. Here's a list of potential issues:

Plaintext credentials: The SMTP credentials (username and password) are stored as plaintext in the NotificationSystem struct. This could be a security risk if the struct is exposed or if the program's memory is compromised.
Lack of TLS/SSL: The code doesn't explicitly enable TLS/SSL for the SMTP connection. This could lead to emails being sent over an insecure connection, potentially exposing sensitive information.
No rate limiting: There's no implementation of rate limiting for sending emails. This could be exploited for spam or denial of service attacks.
Potential for email injection: The code doesn't sanitize or validate the email addresses or content, which could potentially lead to email injection attacks.
Lack of logging and auditing: There's no logging mechanism in place, which makes it difficult to track and audit email sending activities.
No input validation: The code doesn't validate inputs (like email addresses) before using them, which could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
Error handling exposure: The current error handling might expose sensitive information if not properly managed when in production.
Hardcoded sender email: The sender email address is hardcoded, which isn't flexible and could pose issues if the address needs to change.
No protection against timing attacks: The code doesn't implement any measures to prevent timing attacks that could be used to enumerate valid email addresses.
Lack of email templating system: While not strictly a security issue, the lack of a proper templating system could lead to inconsistencies or errors in email content, potentially causing confusion or mistrust among users.

To improve the security of this system, we would need to address these issues, implement proper encryption for sensitive data, use secure connections, add input validation and sanitization, implement rate limiting and logging, and follow best practices for email handling and authentication.
