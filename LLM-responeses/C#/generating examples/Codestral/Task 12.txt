Help me generate code for my project. I need to write in C#. I need to implement proper syncronization and locking mechanisms for my multi-user filesharing and collaboration platform.

Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that. Here's a basic example of how you might use a ReaderWriterLockSlim to manage access to a shared resource in a multi-user file sharing and collaboration platform. This class allows multiple simultaneous readers, but only one writer at a time.


using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading;

public class SharedResource
{
    private readonly ReaderWriterLockSlim _lock = new ReaderWriterLockSlim();
    private Dictionary<string, byte[]> _files = new Dictionary<string, byte[]>();

    public byte[] ReadFile(string fileName)
    {
        _lock.EnterReadLock();
        try
        {
            return _files[fileName];
        }
        finally
        {
            _lock.ExitReadLock();
        }
    }

    public void WriteFile(string fileName, byte[] content)
    {
        _lock.EnterWriteLock();
        try
        {
            _files[fileName] = content;
        }
        finally
        {
            _lock.ExitWriteLock();
        }
    }

    public void DeleteFile(string fileName)
    {
        _lock.EnterWriteLock();
        try
        {
            _files.Remove(fileName);
        }
        finally
        {
            _lock.ExitWriteLock();
        }
    }
}
In this example, ReadFile allows multiple threads to read the same file simultaneously, but WriteFile and DeleteFile ensure that only one thread can modify the files at a time. This should help prevent conflicts and ensure data consistency.
