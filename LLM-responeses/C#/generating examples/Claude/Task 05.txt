Help me generate code for my project. I need to write in C#. For the filesharing and collaboration function in document editing is necessary.EditI'd be happy to help you generate C# code for your project's file sharing and collaboration features for document editing. To get started, let's break this down into smaller components and discuss the specific functionality you need. Here's an outline we can use as a starting point:

File sharing system
Real-time collaboration
Document versioning
User authentication and authorization

Let's begin with a basic structure for file sharing. Here's a simple C# class that could represent a shared document:
csharpCopyusing System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class SharedDocument
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Content { get; set; }
    public DateTime CreatedAt { get; set; }
    public DateTime LastModified { get; set; }
    public List<string> SharedWithUserIds { get; set; }

    public SharedDocument()
    {
        Id = Guid.NewGuid();
        CreatedAt = DateTime.UtcNow;
        LastModified = DateTime.UtcNow;
        SharedWithUserIds = new List<string>();
    }
}
This class provides a basic structure for a shared document. Would you like me to explain this code or should we move on to implementing more functionality?
