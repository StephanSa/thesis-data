Help me generate code for my project. I Need to write in C#. I need email notifications for accout-relatedevents and file-relateed activities for my multi-user filesharing and collaboration platform.EditI'd be happy to help you generate C# code for email notifications in your multi-user file sharing and collaboration platform. Let's break this down into two main categories: account-related events and file-related activities. We'll create a simple email notification system using SMTP.
First, let's create a basic EmailService class:
csharpCopyusing System;
using System.Net;
using System.Net.Mail;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class EmailService
{
    private readonly string _smtpServer;
    private readonly int _smtpPort;
    private readonly string _senderEmail;
    private readonly string _senderPassword;

    public EmailService(string smtpServer, int smtpPort, string senderEmail, string senderPassword)
    {
        _smtpServer = smtpServer;
        _smtpPort = smtpPort;
        _senderEmail = senderEmail;
        _senderPassword = senderPassword;
    }

    public async Task SendEmailAsync(string recipientEmail, string subject, string body)
    {
        using (var client = new SmtpClient(_smtpServer, _smtpPort))
        {
            client.EnableSsl = true;
            client.UseDefaultCredentials = false;
            client.Credentials = new NetworkCredential(_senderEmail, _senderPassword);

            var message = new MailMessage(_senderEmail, recipientEmail, subject, body);
            message.IsBodyHtml = true;

            await client.SendMailAsync(message);
        }
    }
}
Now, let's create classes for account-related and file-related notifications:
csharpCopypublic class AccountNotificationService
{
    private readonly EmailService _emailService;

    public AccountNotificationService(EmailService emailService)
    {
        _emailService = emailService;
    }

    public async Task SendRegistrationConfirmationAsync(string userEmail)
    {
        string subject = "Welcome to Our Platform";
        string body = "Thank you for registering. Your account has been successfully created.";
        await _emailService.SendEmailAsync(userEmail, subject, body);
    }

    public async Task SendPasswordResetAsync(string userEmail, string resetLink)
    {
        string subject = "Password Reset Request";
        string body = $"Click the following link to reset your password: {resetLink}";
        await _emailService.SendEmailAsync(userEmail, subject, body);
    }

    // Add more account-related notification methods as needed
}

public class FileNotificationService
{
    private readonly EmailService _emailService;

    public FileNotificationService(EmailService emailService)
    {
        _emailService = emailService;
    }

    public async Task SendFileUploadNotificationAsync(string userEmail, string fileName)
    {
        string subject = "File Upload Confirmation";
        string body = $"Your file '{fileName}' has been successfully uploaded.";
        await _emailService.SendEmailAsync(userEmail, subject, body);
    }

    public async Task SendFileSharedNotificationAsync(string recipientEmail, string sharedByEmail, string fileName)
    {
        string subject = "New File Shared With You";
        string body = $"{sharedByEmail} has shared the file '{fileName}' with you.";
        await _emailService.SendEmailAsync(recipientEmail, subject, body);
    }

    // Add more file-related notification methods as needed
}
To use these services in your application, you would first set up the EmailService with your SMTP server details, then create instances of AccountNotificationService and FileNotificationService. Here's an example of how you might use these in your application:
csharpCopy// In your startup or configuration code
var emailService = new EmailService("smtp.example.com", 587, "sender@example.com", "password");
var accountNotificationService = new AccountNotificationService(emailService);
var fileNotificationService = new FileNotificationService(emailService);

// In your account registration logic
await accountNotificationService.SendRegistrationConfirmationAsync(newUser.Email);

// In your file upload logic
await fileNotificationService.SendFileUploadNotificationAsync(currentUser.Email, uploadedFileName);

// In your file sharing logic
await fileNotificationService.SendFileSharedNotificationAsync(recipientUser.Email, currentUser.Email, sharedFileName);
This code provides a basic structure for sending email notifications for various events in your platform. You can expand on this by adding more specific notification methods to each service as needed for your application.
Would you like me to explain or break down any part of this code?
