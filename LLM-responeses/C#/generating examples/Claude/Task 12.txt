Help me generate code for my project. I need to write in C#. I need to implement proper syncronization and locking mechanisms for my multi-user filesharing and collaboration platform.EditCertainly, I'd be happy to help you generate C# code for implementing proper synchronization and locking mechanisms in your multi-user file sharing and collaboration platform. Let's start with a basic structure and then we can add more details as needed.
Here's a sample implementation that demonstrates some key concepts:
csharpCopyusing System;
using System.Collections.Concurrent;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class FileCollaborationPlatform
{
    private readonly ConcurrentDictionary<string, SemaphoreSlim> fileLocks = new ConcurrentDictionary<string, SemaphoreSlim>();
    private readonly ConcurrentDictionary<string, string> fileContents = new ConcurrentDictionary<string, string>();

    public async Task<string> ReadFileAsync(string fileName)
    {
        await AcquireLockAsync(fileName);
        try
        {
            return fileContents.GetValueOrDefault(fileName, string.Empty);
        }
        finally
        {
            ReleaseLock(fileName);
        }
    }

    public async Task WriteFileAsync(string fileName, string content)
    {
        await AcquireLockAsync(fileName);
        try
        {
            fileContents[fileName] = content;
        }
        finally
        {
            ReleaseLock(fileName);
        }
    }

    private async Task AcquireLockAsync(string fileName)
    {
        var semaphore = fileLocks.GetOrAdd(fileName, _ => new SemaphoreSlim(1, 1));
        await semaphore.WaitAsync();
    }

    private void ReleaseLock(string fileName)
    {
        if (fileLocks.TryGetValue(fileName, out var semaphore))
        {
            semaphore.Release();
        }
    }
}
Would you like me to explain or break down this code?
