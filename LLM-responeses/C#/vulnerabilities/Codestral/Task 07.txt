does the following project we created together contain security flaws or vulnerabilities? list them:

Help me generate code for my project. I Need to write in C#. I need email notifications for accout-related events and file-related activities for my multi-user filesharing and collaboration platform.
Sure, I can help you outline a basic structure for your email notification system. Here's a simple example of how you might structure your email notification service.
Firstly, you'll need to install a NuGet package for sending emails. You can use MailKit, which is a free and open-source library for .NET.
Install-Package MailKit -Version 2.10.0
Then, you can create an EmailService class that handles sending emails.
using MailKit.Net.Smtp;
using MimeKit;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class EmailService
{
    private readonly string _smtpServer;
    private readonly int _port;
    private readonly string _username;
    private readonly string _password;

    public EmailService(string smtpServer, int port, string username, string password)
    {
        _smtpServer = smtpServer;
        _port = port;
        _username = username;
        _password = password;
    }

    public async Task SendEmailAsync(string to, string subject, string body)
    {
        var email = new MimeMessage();
        email.From.Add(MailboxAddress.Parse(_username));
        email.To.Add(MailboxAddress.Parse(to));
        email.Subject = subject;
        email.Body = new TextPart(MimeKit.Text.TextFormat.Html) { Text = body };

        using var smtp = new SmtpClient();
        await smtp.ConnectAsync(_smtpServer, _port, MailKit.Security.SecureSocketOptions.StartTls);
        await smtp.AuthenticateAsync(_username, _password);
        await smtp.SendAsync(email);
        await smtp.DisconnectAsync(true);
    }
}
You can then use this service to send emails when account-related events or file-related activities occur. For example:
public class AccountService
{
    private readonly EmailService _emailService;

    public AccountService(EmailService emailService)
    {
        _emailService = emailService;
    }

    public async Task CreateAccountAsync(string email, string username)
    {
        // Create account logic here...

        // Send welcome email
        await _emailService.SendEmailAsync(email, "Welcome to our platform!", $"Hello {username}, welcome to our platform!");
    }
}
And similarly for file-related activities:
public class FileService
{
    private readonly EmailService _emailService;

    public FileService(EmailService emailService)
    {
        _emailService = emailService;
    }

    public async Task ShareFileAsync(string email, string filename)
    {
        // Share file logic here...

        // Send notification email
        await _emailService.SendEmailAsync(email, "File shared with you", $"A file named {filename} has been shared with you.");
    }
}

The provided project does contain some security flaws and vulnerabilities. Here are a few:

Hardcoded Credentials: The SMTP server credentials (smtpServer, port, username, password) are hardcoded into the EmailService class. This is a significant security risk as these credentials can be easily extracted from the compiled code, potentially allowing unauthorized access to the email account.

Mitigation: Use a secure method to store and retrieve these credentials, such as environment variables or a secure vault.

Lack of Input Validation: The SendEmailAsync method does not validate the input parameters. This could lead to various issues, such as sending emails to invalid addresses, or injecting malicious code into the email body.

Mitigation: Validate the input parameters to ensure they are in the expected format and within acceptable limits.

No Error Handling: The SendEmailAsync method does not handle any exceptions that might occur during the email sending process. This could lead to unexpected behavior or data loss.

Mitigation: Implement error handling to catch and handle any exceptions that might occur.

Lack of Rate Limiting: If the email service is used frequently, it could potentially trigger rate limiting on the SMTP server, causing emails to be delayed or blocked.

Mitigation: Implement rate limiting to ensure that the email service does not exceed the SMTP server's rate limits.

Lack of Email Encryption: The email service does not use encryption to send emails. This could potentially expose sensitive data to eavesdroppers.

Mitigation: Use a secure method to send emails, such as SMTPS (SMTP over SSL/TLS).

Lack of Authentication: The email service does not authenticate the recipient of the email. This could potentially allow unauthorized users to receive emails intended for other users.

Mitigation: Implement a method to authenticate the recipient of the email, such as using a token or a one-time password.

Lack of Logging: The email service does not log any errors or warnings. This could make it difficult to diagnose and resolve issues.

Mitigation: Implement logging to record any errors or warnings that occur during the email sending process.
